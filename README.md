The ADT SortedBag is a data structure that stores elements in a binary search tree (BST) using a linked representation on an array. Each node in the BST contains a (unique element, frequency) pair, where the frequency represents how many times the element appears in the bag. The tree maintains a sorted structure based on a given ordering relation, ensuring efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. When an element is added, its frequency is incremented if it already exists; otherwise, a new node is inserted following BST rules. This approach provides a balance between efficient memory usage and fast access to elements while maintaining sorted order.
